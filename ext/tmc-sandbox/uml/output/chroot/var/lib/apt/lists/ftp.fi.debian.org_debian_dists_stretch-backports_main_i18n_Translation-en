Package: acmetool
Description-md5: 3e5e145ae880b97f3b6e825daf35ce32
Description-en: automatic certificate acquisition tool for Let's Encrypt
 acmetool is an easy-to-use command line tool for automatically
 acquiring TLS certificates from ACME (Automated Certificate Management
 Environment) servers such as Let's Encrypt, designed to flexibly
 integrate into your webserver setup to enable automatic verification.
 .
 acmetool is designed to work like make: you specify what certificates
 you want, and acmetool obtains certificates as necessary to satisfy
 those requirements. If the requirements are already satisfied,
 acmetool doesn't do anything when invoked. Thus, acmetool is
 ideally suited for use on a cron job; it will do nothing until
 certificates are near expiry, and then obtain new ones.
 .
 acmetool is designed to minimise the use of state and be transparent
 in the state that it does use. All state, including certificates, is
 stored in a single directory, by default /var/lib/acme. The schema
 for this directory is simple, comprehensible and documented.

Description-md5: 479d7434bd03973bbda4b1be59f8e98d
Description-en: XMPP gateway to connect to IRC servers
 Biboumi is an XMPP gateway that connects to IRC servers and translates
 between the two protocols. It can be used to access IRC channels using
 any XMPP client as if these channels were XMPP MUCs.
 .
 It is written in modern C++14 and makes great efforts to have as little
 dependencies and to be as simple as possible.
 .
 The goal is to provide a way to access most of IRC features using any
 XMPP client.  It doesn’t however try to provide a complete mapping of
 the features of both worlds simply because this is not useful and most
 probably impossible.  For example all IRC modes are not all
 translatable into an XMPP features.  Some of them are (like +m (mute)
 or +o (operator) modes), but some others are IRC-specific.  If IRC is
 the limiting factor (for example you cannot have a non-ASCII nickname
 on IRC) then biboumi doesn’t try to work around this issue: it just
 enforces the rules of the IRC server by telling the user that he/she
 must choose an ASCII-only nickname.  An important goal is to keep the
 software (and its code) light and simple.

 dynamic libraries.  Static libraries are no longer redistributed.

Package: boinc-manager
Description-md5: 18cdf3bcfd01c25a71225cc0291571cd
Description-en: GUI to control and monitor the BOINC core client
 The Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) is a
 software platform for distributed computing using volunteered computer
 resources.
 .
 This package contains the BOINC Manager, a graphical monitor and
 control utility for the BOINC core client. It gives a detailed
 overview of the state of the client it is monitoring, as there are
  * attached projects
  * running tasks
  * file transfers between the client and project servers
  * statistics about granted credits and disk usage for every project
  * constraints on CPU usage
 The BOINC Manager has two modes of operation, the "Simple View" in which
 it only displays the most important information and the "Advanced View"
 in which all information and all control elements are available.
 .
 For active participation in any BOINC project the recommended
 boinc-client package, not the boinc-manager, is required for every
 machine contributing.

Package: boinc-screensaver
Description-md5: ba066f78393e8713c0e55232ad35eddf
Description-en: screen saver auto-controlling volunteer computing
 The Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) is a
 software platform for distributed computing: several initiatives of
 various scientific disciplines all compete for the idle time of
 desktop computers. The developers' web site at the University of
 Berkeley serves as a common portal to the otherwise independently run
 projects.
 .
 The BOINC client is configurable by the command line or the BOINC
 manager's GUI to compute with any range between 0% and 100% of
 available resources, and to change that ratio to a higher after
 some user determined duration of inactivity. There is now quite
 a number of individuals who prefer to have everything presented
 with their accustomed principle for setting and choosing a screen
 saver. Upon inactivity, the BOINC client is started, and stopped
 again when the user is back. To save the screen, it then shows
 the graphical progress indication as optionally shown also by
 the manager.
 .
 This package is excellent to further promote BOINC, recalling the
 effect SETI@Home once had in the Cambridge, UK, CB2 Cybercafe.
 Just, when using it together with the regular BOINC client setup,
 it is suggested not to have all CPUs used to avoid multiple
 processes running on the same core.

 commonly started for every core, it is essential to have memory
 shared as much as possible between binaries of all projects.

Package: borgbackup
Description-md5: 8a56876615c13f6f25a373ef5d5c2017
Description-en: deduplicating and compressing backup program
 Borg is a deduplicating and compressing backup program. Optionally, it
 also supports authenticated encryption. It was forked from the attic
 backup program.
 .
 The main goal of Borg is to provide an efficient and secure way to
 backup data. The data deduplication technique used makes Borg suitable
 for daily backups since only the changes are stored. The authenticated
 encryption makes it suitable for backups to not fully trusted targets.
 .
 It can push backups to remote repositories accessed via ssh. A client
 pushing a backup invokes "borg serve" on the repository host. It is
 possible to restrict the ssh key to "borg serve" using the
 authorized_keys command= clause.
 .
 Please note that the server and the client should be on the same
 version of borgbackup. Using different versions of borgbackup on
 client and server might result in 'incompatible API version' error
 messages and a non-working backup.
 .
 While there is no direct operations mode for pull-type backups, you
 can configure the backup target in append-only mode, preventing the
 backup source from deleting or altering previous backups.

Package: calendar-exchange-provider
Description-md5: d931438fc31dbbe54cc41d0e6c3a14a2
Description-en: MS Exchange support for Thunderbird/Lightning
 This plugin allows one to communicate with an Exchange 2007 or 2010 server
 using the Exchange Web Service (EWS) interface.
 .
 Plugin works with the Exchange Webservice Server of Exchange 2007 or 2010 or
 that from Microsoft Office 365.
 .
 With this plugin, you can perform these tasks from within Thunderbird:
 .
  * Sync Calendar and Task/Todo items from an EWS (Exchange) server. Syncing is
    done on a user settable poll interval. It will track changes on the server
    and update the local memory cache.
  * Create, modify and delete calendar events and Task/Todo items. They will get
    synced immediately with the EWS server.
  * During creation of a new calendar you can use the Exchange Autodiscover
    functionality (when enabled on the Exchange server) to find the right server
    and mailbox settings. Selecting the right folder is easy with the build-in
    folder browser.
  * Access any Calendar or Task folder on your EWS server as long as you have
    the right primary SMTP or alias email address and access permissions.
  * Poll your inbox for meeting invitation request or cancellations. They will
    show up in your calendar.
  * Manage how meeting invitations or cancellations are automatically handled
    (responded to).
  * Add as many calendar objects as you wish and iceowl-extension will allow.
  * Manage "Out of Office" settings for each calendar mailbox
  * Import ICS files.
  * Manage and view attachments.
  * Look at user availability (Free/Busy) information.

 You can use Cert Spotter to detect:
  * Certificates issued to attackers who have compromised a certificate
    authority and want to impersonate your site.
  * Certificates issued to attackers who are using your infrastructure
    to serve malware.
  * Certificates issued in violation of your corporate policy
    or outside of your centralized certificate procurement process.
  * Certificates issued to your infrastructure providers without your
    consent.

Description-md5: 9bb162e0cc542877672e43a15da10cd8
Description-en: virtual lighttable and darkroom for photographers
 Darktable manages your digital negatives in a database and lets you view
 them  through a zoomable lighttable. it also enables you to develop raw
 images and enhance them.
 .
 It tries to fill the gap between the many excellent existing free
 raw converters and image management tools (such as ufraw or f-spot).
 The user interface is built around efficient caching of image metadata and
 mipmaps, all stored in a database. the user will always be able to interact,
 even if the full resolution image is not yet loaded.
 .
 All editing is fully non-destructive and only operates on cached image
 buffers for display. the full image is only converted during export. The
 frontend is written in gtk+/cairo, the database uses sqlite3, raw image
 loading is done using rawspeed, high-dynamic range, and standard image formats
 such as jpeg are also supported. The core operates completely on floating
 point values, so darktable can not only be used for photography but also for
 scientifically acquired images or output of renderers (high dynamic range).

Package: detox
Description-md5: 57a56ea30e81ef29e23165136cbfe243
Description-en: replace problematic characters in filenames
 detox is a utility designed to clean up filenames. It replaces difficult to
 work with characters, such as spaces, with standard equivalents. It will also
 clean up filenames with UTF-8 or Latin-1 (or CP-1252) characters in them.
 .
 Features:
  * Removal or replacement of upper ASCII Latin-1 (ISO 8859-1) characters;
  * Removal or replacement of UTF-8 encoded Unicode characters;
  * Removal or replacement of spaces and other potentially tricky characters;
  * Trimming of excessive "_" and "-"s;
  * Directory recursion, dry runs, verbose listings.
 .
 It is designed with safety in mind. It won't overwrite a file that already
 exists, and it doesn't touch special files if not requested.
 .
 detox is useful to mass rename files automatically. As just one example,
 you can use detox to easily standardize lots of files, as MP3 or movies,
 downloaded or stored inside a directory.
 .
 This package provides detox and inline-detox commands. The inline-detox can
 be used in command lines, as a filter in shell procedures.

Package: dh-linktree
Description-md5: 7ef44f371b55fb620fe2ec953830eab4
Description-en: Create symlink trees within a Debian package
 Many developers bundle PHP or JavaScript libraries in the software that
 they provide. The Debian packager must then replace those "embedded copies"
 with symlinks to the packaged copy of those files. This operation is not
 without risks. A version mismatch can be the source of bugs that are hard to
 track.
 .
 dh_linktree is a tool that can assist you in this task. It can either
 unconditionally install a symlink tree of a given directory at the place
 of your choice, or it can only replace existing files with symlinks, or it
 can only replace existing identical files with symlinks.

 Diaspora (currently styled diaspora* and formerly styled DIASPORA*) is a free
 personal web server that implements a distributed social networking service.
 Installations of the software form nodes (termed "pods") which make up the
 distributed Diaspora social network.
 .
 Diaspora is intended to address privacy concerns related to centralized
 social networks by allowing users to set up their own server (or "pod") to
 host content; pods can then interact to share status updates, photographs,
 and other social data. It allows its users to host their data with a
 traditional web host, a cloud-based host, an ISP, or a friend. The framework,
 which is being built on Ruby on Rails, is free software and can be
 experimented with by external developers.
 .

Description-en: Erlang/Elixir XMPP parsing and serialization library
 This library provides comprehensive representation of XMPP elements as
 well as tools to work with them. Every such element is represented by an
 Erlang record. Most of the library's code is auto generated and thus
 considered to be bug free and efficient.
 .
 The approach is very similar to ASN.1, Google Protocol Buffers or Apache
 Thrift: an XML element is transformed into internal language structure
 (an Erlang record in this case) - the process known as "decoding". During
 decoding, validation is also performed, thus well-typed structures are
 generated, potentially decreasing bugs related to handcrafted parsing. A
 reverse process known as "encoding" is applied for transforming an
 Erlang record into an XML element.
 .
 This package should be used along with erlang-p1-xml, because it is
 only able to decode from and encode to structures generated by that
 library (that is, xmlel() elements).

 large infrastructures and clusters.
 .
 It's a tool for mass unattended Linux installation. You can take one
 or more virgin systems, turn on the power, and after a few minutes,
 the systems are installed, and completely configured to your exact
 needs, without any interaction necessary.
 .
 This package is needed for setting up a FAI install server for network
 installations, for running the dirinstall in a chroot environment, and
 to build installation CD/DVD's and USB sticks.

Package: fai-setup-storage
Description-md5: 502d77c2ec6201c8824b93be76330a6f
Description-en: automatically prepare storage devices
 Using FAI disk_config files, setup-storage computes effective
 partition and volume sizes and executes the necessary commands
 to configure storage devices. It manages disk drives as well
 as RAID and LVM volumes. It handles all file systems supported
 by parted(8) as well as ntfs but is flexible enough to be
 extended to further types as well. Once the storage devices
 are prepared, an appropriate fstab(5) file is generated.
 .
 This package provides the setup-storage utility as separate
 package so it can be used independent from FAI as well.

Package: flatpak
Description-md5: f91acb1d2880527b2759bc5e2d99fbff
Description-en: Application deployment framework for desktop apps
 Flatpak installs, manages and runs sandboxed desktop application bundles.
 Application bundles run partially isolated from the wider system, using
 containerization techniques such as namespaces to prevent direct access
 to system resources. Resources from outside the sandbox can be accessed
 via "portal" services, which are responsible for access control; for
 example, the Documents portal displays an "Open" dialog outside the
 sandbox, then allows the application to access only the selected file.
 .
 Each application uses a specified "runtime", or set of libraries, which is
 available as /usr inside its sandbox. This can be used to run application
 bundles with multiple, potentially incompatible sets of dependencies within
 the same desktop environment.
 .
 This package contains the services and executables needed to install and
 launch sandboxed applications, and the portal services needed to provide
 limited access to resources outside the sandbox.

Description-md5: 606237586cd533eed7972349938eab1e
Description-en: HTTP request pipeline suitable for use across multiple go-routines
 Package autorest implements an HTTP request pipeline suitable for use across
 multiple go-routines and provides the shared routines relied on by AutoRest
 (see https://github.com/Azure/autorest/) generated Go code.
 .
 The package breaks sending and responding to HTTP requests into three phases:
 Preparing, Sending, and Responding.
 .
 Each phase relies on decorators to modify and / or manage processing.
 Decorators may first modify and then pass the data along, pass the data first
 and then modify the result, or wrap themselves around passing the data (such as
 a logger might do). Decorators run in the order provided.
 .
 Preparers and Responders may be shared and re-used (assuming the underlying
 decorators support sharing and re-use). Performant use is obtained by creating
 one or more Preparers and Responders shared among multiple go-routines, and a
 single Sender shared among multiple sending go-routines, all bound together by
 means of input / output channels.
 .
 Decorators hold their passed state within a closure (such as the path
 components in the example above). Be careful to share Preparers and Responders
 only in a context where such held state applies. For example, it may not make
 sense to share a Preparer that applies a query string from a fixed set of
 values. Similarly, sharing a Responder that reads the response body into a
 passed struct (e.g., ByUnmarshallingJson) is likely incorrect.
 .
 Lastly, the Swagger specification (https://swagger.io) that drives AutoRest
 (https://github.com/Azure/autorest/) precisely defines two date forms: date and
 date-time. The github.com/Azure/go-autorest/autorest/date package provides
 time.Time derivations to ensure correct parsing and formatting.
 .
 Errors raised by autorest objects and methods will conform to the
 autorest.Error interface.

Package: golang-github-google-go-cmp-dev
Description-md5: a570016be8c1a78ee8634131254d0f7f
Description-en: Package for comparing Go values in tests
 This package is intended to be a more powerful and safer alternative to
 reflect.DeepEqual for comparing whether two values are semantically equal.
 .
 The primary features of cmp are:
  * When the default behavior of equality does not suit the needs of the test,
    custom equality functions can override the equality operation.  For
    example, an equality function may report floats as equal so long as they
    are within some tolerance of each other.
  * Types that have an Equal method may use that method to determine equality.
    This allows package authors to determine the equality operation for the
    types that they define.
  * If no custom equality functions are used and no Equal method is defined,
    equality is determined by recursively comparing the primitive kinds on both
    values, much like reflect.DeepEqual. Unlike reflect.DeepEqual, unexported
    fields are not compared by default; they result in panics unless suppressed
    by using an Ignore option (see cmpopts.IgnoreUnexported) or explicitly
    compared using the AllowUnexported option.
 .

Description-en: Golang package for gossip based membership and failure detection
 memberlist is a Go library that manages cluster membership and member failure
 detection using a gossip based protocol.
 .
 The use cases for such a library are far-reaching: all distributed systems
 require membership, and memberlist is a re-usable solution to managing cluster
 membership and node failure detection.
 .
 memberlist is eventually consistent but converges quickly on average. The speed
 at which it converges can be heavily tuned via various knobs on the protocol.
 Node failures are detected and network partitions are partially tolerated by
 attempting to communicate to potentially dead nodes through multiple routes.

   You need some keepalive/heartbeat mechanims in the application-level.
   A real world example is to use some multiplexing protocol over session,
   such as smux (golang-github-xtaci-smux-dev) with embedded keepalive
   mechanism. See kcptun (https://github.com/xtaci/kcptun) for example.

Package: golang-github-xtaci-smux-dev
Description-md5: 9c27424e435371b37bdce683ab7d8c64
Description-en: Simple Multiplexing for golang
 Smux (Simple MUltipleXing) is a multiplexing library for Golang.
 It relies on an underlying connection to provide reliability and ordering,
 such as TCP or KCP (golang-github-xtaci-kcp-dev), and provides
 stream-oriented multiplexing.
 .
 The original intention of this library is to power the connection
 management for KCP (golang-github-xtaci-kcp-dev).
 .
 Features:
   * Tiny, less than 600 LOC.
   * Token bucket controlled receiving, which provides smoother bandwidth
     graph.
   * Session-wide receive buffer, shared among streams, tightly controlled
     overall memory usage.
   * Minimized header(8Bytes), maximized payload.
   * Well-tested on millions of devices in kcptun.

Package: hedgewars
Description-md5: 95a283ed5766101c57cbbde0d1b67a66
Description-en: Funny turn-based artillery game, featuring fighting hedgehogs!
 Each player controls a team of several hedgehogs. During the
 course of the game, players take turns with one of their
 hedgehogs. They then use whatever tools and weapons are
 available to attack and kill the opponents' hedgehogs, thereby
 winning the game. Hedgehogs may move around the terrain in a
 variety of ways, normally by walking and jumping but also by
 using particular tools such as the "Rope" or "Parachute", to
 move to otherwise inaccessible areas. Each turn is time-limited
 to ensure that players do not hold up the game with excessive
 thinking or moving.
 .
 A large variety of tools and weapons are available for players
 during the game: Grenade, Cluster Bomb, Bazooka, UFO, Homing Bee,
 Shotgun, Desert Eagle, Fire Punch, Baseball Bat, Dynamite, Mine,
 Rope, Pneumatic pick, Parachute. Most weapons, when used, cause
 explosions that deform the terrain, removing circular chunks.
 The landscape is an island floating on a body of water, or a
 restricted cave with water at the bottom. A hedgehog dies when
 it enters the water (either by falling off the island, or
 through a hole in the bottom of it), it is thrown off either
 side of the arena or when its health is reduced, typically from
 contact with explosions, to zero (the damage dealt to the
 attacked hedgehog or hedgehogs after a player's or CPU turn is
 shown only when all movement on the battlefield has ceased).

 using the jupp package and implementation (both binaries and manpages).
 It also contains the appropriate conffiles and, in contrast to Debian's
 joe flavour, supports SELinux context copying (on Debian systems with
 the Linux kernel), and has many bugs fixed and makes some of jupps new
 features available to the joe, jstar, jmacs, jpico and rjoe flavours.

Package: jupp
Description-md5: 758a80f0d3a3d8d4d242d368cca88861
Description-en: user friendly full screen text editor
 Joe, the Joe's Own Editor, has the feel of most PC text editors: the key
 sequences are reminiscent of WordStar and Turbo C editors, but the feature
 set is much larger than of those.  Joe has all of the features a Unix
 user should expect: full use of termcap/terminfo, complete VI-style Unix
 integration, a powerful configuration file, and regular expression search
 system.  It also has eight help reference cards which are always available,
 and an intuitive, simple, and well thought-out user interface.
 .
 Joe has a great screen update optimisation algorithm, multiple windows
 (through/between which you can scroll) and lacks the confusing notion of
 named buffers.  It has command history, TAB expansion in file selection
 menus, undo and redo functions, (un)indenting and paragraph formatting,
 filtering highlighted blocks through any external Unix command, editing
 a pipe into or out of a command, block move, copy, delete or filter, a
 bracketed paste mode automatically enabled on xterm-xfree86 and decimal
 and hexadecimal gotos for lines, columns, and file offsets.
 .
 Through simple QEdit-style configuration files, Joe can be set up to
 emulate editors such as Pico and Emacs, along with a complete imitation
 of WordStar in non-document mode, and a restricted mode version (lets you
 edit only the files specified on the command line). Joe also has a deferred
 screen update to handle typeahead, and it ensures that deferral is not
 bypassed by tty buffering. It's usable even at 2400 baud, and it will work
 on any kind of sane terminal. Furthermore, it supports SELinux context
 copying on Debian systems with the Linux kernel.
 .
 This version of JOE only comes with the Jupp flavour, to not conflict
 with the Debian joe package, activated. The resource files and executable
 links and menu entries for the other flavours are still available, though,
 in the joe-jupp package.

 package by just running make-kpkg kernel_image in a kernel source
 directory tree.  It can also package the relevant kernel headers into
 a kernel-headers package. In general, this package is very useful if
 you need to create a custom kernel, if, for example, the default
 kernel does not support some of your hardware, or you wish a leaner,
 meaner kernel.  It also scripts the steps that need be taken to
 compile the kernel, which is quite convenient (forgetting a crucial
 step once was the initial motivation for this package). Please look at

Package: librelp-dev
Description-md5: 42c1d0b6aeb68e5586482de4937a9e25
Description-en: Reliable Event Logging Protocol (RELP) library - development files
 RELP provides reliable event logging over the network.
 .
 RELP (and hence) librelp assures that no message is lost, not even when
 connections break and a peer becomes unavailable. The current version of
 RELP has a minimal window of opportunity for message duplication after a
 session has been broken due to network problems. In this case, a few messages
 may be duplicated (a problem that also exists with plain tcp syslog). Future
 versions of RELP will address this shortcoming.
 .
 Please note that RELP is a general-purpose, extensible logging protocol. Even
 though it was designed to solve the urgent need of rsyslog-to-rsyslog
 communication, RELP supports many more applications. Extensible command verbs
 provide ample opportunity to extend the protocol without affecting existing
 applications.

 The tool supports acquiring memory either to the file system of the
 device or over the network. LiME is unique in that it is the first
 tool that allows full memory captures from Android devices. It also
 minimizes its interaction between user and kernel space processes
 during acquisition. It will produce memory captures that are more
 forensically sound than those of other tools designed for Linux
 memory acquisition. The dump format provided as "lime" is fully
 compatible with volatility framework.
 .
 This package provides the source code for the lime-forensics kernel
 modules to be build with dkms.

Package: lintian
Description-md5: ea0553cc9ee5ab9a0505303638c060d4
Description-en: Debian package checker
 Lintian dissects Debian packages and reports bugs and policy
 violations. It contains automated checks for many aspects of Debian
 policy as well as some checks for common errors.
 .
 It uses an archive directory, called laboratory, in which it stores
 information about the packages it examines.  It can keep this
 information between multiple invocations in order to avoid repeating
 expensive data-collection operations. This makes it possible to check the
 complete Debian archive for bugs, in a reasonable time.
 .
 This package is useful for all people who want to check Debian
 packages for compliance with Debian policy. Every Debian maintainer
 should check packages with this tool before uploading them to the
 archive.
 .
 This version of Lintian is calibrated for policy version 4.1.3.

 files into the guest.
 .
 hv_kvp_daemon provides the key-value pair (KVP) service, allowing the host
 to get and set the IP networking configuration of the guest.  (This
 requires helper scripts which are not currently included.)
 .
 hv_vss_daemon provides the volume shadow copy service (VSS), allowing the
 host to freeze the guest filesystems while taking a snapshot.

Package: libfuzzer-5.0-dev
Description-md5: bc55cd127b8dab148b78e61e5e475b8e
Description-en: Library for coverage-guided fuzz testing
 LibFuzzer is a library for in-process, coverage-guided, evolutionary fuzzing
 of other libraries.
 .
 LibFuzzer is similar in concept to American Fuzzy Lop (AFL), but it performs
 all of its fuzzing inside a single process. This in-process fuzzing can be
 more restrictive and fragile, but is potentially much faster as there is no
 overhead for process start-up.
 .
 The fuzzer is linked with the library under test, and feeds fuzzed inputs to
 the library via a specific fuzzing entrypoint (aka 'target function'); the
 fuzzer then tracks which areas of the code are reached, and generates mutations
 on the corpus of input data in order to maximize the code coverage. The code
 coverage information for libFuzzer is provided by LLVM's SanitizerCoverage
 instrumentation.

Description-en: Modular compiler and toolchain technologies
 LLVM is a collection of libraries and tools that make it easy to build
 compilers, optimizers, just-in-time code generators, and many other
 compiler-related programs.
 .
 LLVM uses a single, language-independent virtual instruction set both
 as an offline code representation (to communicate code between
 compiler phases and to run-time systems) and as the compiler internal
 representation (to analyze and transform programs). This persistent
 code representation allows a common set of sophisticated compiler
 techniques to be applied at compile-time, link-time, install-time,
 run-time, or "idle-time" (between program runs).
 .
 The strengths of the LLVM infrastructure are its extremely
 simple design (which makes it easy to understand and use),
 source-language independence, powerful mid-level optimizer, automated
 compiler debugging support, extensibility, and its stability and
 reliability. LLVM is currently being used to host a wide variety of
 academic research projects and commercial projects. LLVM includes C
 and C++ front-ends, a front-end for a Forth-like language (Stacker),
 a young scheme front-end, and Java support is in development. LLVM can
 generate code for X86, SparcV9, PowerPC or many other architectures.

Package: mksh
Description-md5: 2809d412e12a286f105f3183079fee7e
Description-en: MirBSD Korn Shell
 mksh is the successor of the Public Domain Korn shell (pdksh),
 a Bourne/POSIX compatible shell which is largely similar to the
 original AT&T Korn Shell (ksh88/ksh93).
 It includes bug fixes and feature improvements, in order to produce a
 modern, robust shell good for interactive and especially script use.
 mksh has UTF-8 support (in string operations and the Emacs editing
 mode). The code has been cleaned up and simplified, bugs fixed,
 standards compliance added, and several enhancements (for extended
 compatibility to other modern shells, as well as a couple of its
 own) are available.
 This shell is Debian Policy 10.4 compliant and works as /bin/sh on
 Debian systems (use the /bin/lksh executable) and is a good rescue
 and initrd shell (consider the /bin/mksh-static executable).
 .
 The mksh binary is a complete, full-featured shell. It provides a
 “consistent across all platforms” guarantee, using 32-bit integers
 for arithmetics, possibly deviating from POSIX.
 .
 The mksh-static binary is a version of mksh, linked against klibc,
 musl, or dietlibc (if they exist for that Debian architecture and
 are usable) and optimised for small code size, for example for use
 on initrd or initramfs images, installation or rescue systems.
 Except for omitting some features to be smaller, it is similar to
 the mksh binary otherwise. Note the exact feature set may differ
 depending on which C library was used to compile it.
 .
 The lksh binary is a script shell based on mksh intended to run old
 ksh88 and pdksh scripts, but not for interactive use. When used as
 /bin/sh it follows POSIX most closely, including use of the host’s
 “long” C data type for arithmetics. It also contains kludges so it
 can run as /bin/sh on Debian beyond what Policy dictates, to work
 around bugs in maintainer scripts and LSB init scripts shipped by
 many packages, such as including a rudimentary printf(1) builtin,
 permitting a shell function to be named stop overriding the default
 alias, more loose interpretation of shell extglobs, etc.
 .
 A sample ~/.mkshrc is included in /usr/share/doc/mksh/examples and
 provided as /etc/mkshrc conffile, which is sourced by another file
 /etc/skel/.mkshrc users are recommended to copy into their home.
 .

Package: python-mockldap
Description-md5: 23de8b6d7d5be802e30ecd53adf42851
Description-en: simple mock implementation of python-ldap (Python2 version)
 This project provides a mock replacement for python-ldap. It’s useful for any
 project that would like to write unit tests against LDAP code without relying
 on a running LDAP server.
 .
 The goal of mockldap is to provide a mock instance of LDAPObject in response to
 any call to ldap.initialize. In the general case, you would register return
 values for all LDAPObject calls that you expect the code under test to make.
 Your assertions would then verify that the tested code behaved correctly given
 this set of return values from the LDAP APIs.
 .
 As a convenience, the mock LDAPObject isn’t just a dumb mock object. The
 typical way to use mockldap is to provide some static directory content and
 then let LDAPObject generate real return values. This will only work for simple
 LDAP operations–this obviously isn’t a complete Python LDAP server
 implementation–but those simple operations tend to cover a lot of cases.
 .
 This package contains the Python 2 version of the library.

 The goal of mockldap is to provide a mock instance of LDAPObject in response to
 any call to ldap.initialize. In the general case, you would register return
 values for all LDAPObject calls that you expect the code under test to make.
 Your assertions would then verify that the tested code behaved correctly given
 this set of return values from the LDAP APIs.
 .
 As a convenience, the mock LDAPObject isn’t just a dumb mock object. The
 typical way to use mockldap is to provide some static directory content and
 then let LDAPObject generate real return values. This will only work for simple
 LDAP operations–this obviously isn’t a complete Python LDAP server
 implementation–but those simple operations tend to cover a lot of cases.
 .
 This package contains the Python 3 version of the library.

Package: libapache2-mod-security2
Description-md5: 198ee1322fd8f21e7b0987f6dfb5edc3
Description-en: Tighten web applications security for Apache
 Modsecurity is an Apache module whose purpose is to tighten the Web
 application security. Effectively, it is an intrusion detection and prevention
 system for the web server.
 .
 At the moment its main features are:
   * Audit log; store full request details in a separate file, including POST
     payloads.
   * Request filtering; incoming requests can be analysed and offensive requests
     can be rejected (or simply logged, if that is what you want). This feature
     can be used to prevent many types of attacks (e.g. XSS attacks, SQL
     injection, ...) and even allow you to run insecure applications on your
     servers (if you have no other choice, of course).

 Core Rules use the following techniques: HTTP request validation, HTTP
 protocol anomalies, Global constraints, HTTP Usage policy, Malicious client
 software detection, Generic Attack Detection (SQL injection, Cross Site
 Scripting, OS Command Injection, ColdFusion, PHP and ASP injection, etc.),
 Trojans & Backdoors Detection, Error Detection, XML Protection, Search Engine

Description-en: MediaWiki API client in Python
 mwclient is a lightweight Python client library to the MediaWiki API
 which provides access to most API functionality. It works with Python
 2.7, 3.3 and above, and supports MediaWiki 1.16 and above. For
 functions not available in the current MediaWiki, a
 MediaWikiVersionError is raised.
 .
 Most properties and generators accept the same parameters as the API,
 without their two-letter prefix. Exceptions to this rule:
 .
  * Image.imageinfo is the imageinfo of the latest image. Earlier
    versions can be fetched using imagehistory()
  * Site.all*: parameter  [ap]from renamed to start
  * categorymembers is implemented as Category.members
  * deletedrevs is deletedrevisions
  * usercontribs is usercontributions
  * First parameters of search and usercontributions are search and
    user respectively
 .
 Properties and generators are implemented as Python generators. Their
 limit parameter is only an indication of the number of items in one
 chunk. It is not the total limit. Doing list(generator(limit =
 limit)) will return ALL items of generator, and not be limited by the
 limit value. Default chunk size is generally the maximum chunk size.

Package: python-pycryptodome
Description-md5: 298f0a0583489a3c2e3c15eb3b38b36d
Description-en: cryptographic Python library (Python 2)
 PyCryptodome is a self-contained Python package of low-level
 cryptographic primitives.
 .
 PyCryptodome is a fork of PyCrypto. It brings several enhancements
 with respect to the last official version of PyCrypto (2.6.1),
 for instance:
 .
   * Authenticated encryption modes (GCM, CCM, EAX, SIV, OCB)
   * Accelerated AES on Intel platforms via AES-NI
   * First class support for PyPy
   * Elliptic curves cryptography (NIST P-256 curve only)
   * Better and more compact API (`nonce` and `iv` attributes for ciphers,
     automatic generation of random nonces and IVs, simplified CTR cipher mode,
     and more)
   * SHA-3 (including SHAKE XOFs) and BLAKE2 hash algorithms
   * Salsa20 and ChaCha20 stream ciphers
   * scrypt and HKDF
   * Deterministic (EC)DSA
   * Password-protected PKCS#8 key containers
   * Shamir's Secret Sharing scheme
   * Random numbers get sourced directly from the OS (and not from a CSPRNG in
     userspace)
   * Simplified install process, including better support for Windows
   * Cleaner RSA and DSA key generation (largely based on FIPS 186-4)
   * Major clean ups and simplification of the code base
 .
 PyCryptodome is not a wrapper to a separate C library like *OpenSSL*.
 To the largest possible extent, algorithms are implemented in pure Python.
 Only the pieces that are extremely critical to performance (e.g. block ciphers)
 are implemented as C extensions.
 .
 This is the Python 2 version of the package.

Package: pyfai
Description-md5: 99681480cbe1e9374e4e00c9c53fdf90
Description-en: Fast Azimuthal Integration scripts
 PyFAI is a Python library for azimuthal integration; it allows the conversion
 of diffraction images taken with 2D detectors like CCD cameras into X-Ray
 powder patterns that can be used by other software like Rietveld refinement
 tools (i.e. FullProf), phase analysis or texture analysis.
 .
 As PyFAI is a library, its main goal is to be integrated in other tools like
 PyMca, LiMa or EDNA. To perform online data analysis, the precise description
 of the experimental setup has to be known. This is the reason why PyFAI
 includes geometry optimization code working on "powder rings" of reference
 samples. Alternatively, PyFAI can also import geometries fitted with other
 tools like Fit2D.
 .
 PyFAI has been designed to work with any kind of detector with any geometry
 (transmission, reflection, off-axis, ...). It uses the Python library FabIO
 to read most images taken by diffractometer.

 This nagios compatible monitoring plugin will check available space and error
 statistics of a btrfs filesystem.
 .
 Traditional space usage monitoring based on the output of df is not sufficient
 when using btrfs. This plugin takes allocated but unused disk space, and
 unallocatable disk space (for example when mixing different sized disks with
 raid profiles) into account. It is meant to be used as an addition to using a
 regular disk usage plugin, based on df output.

 Additionally, the check keeps an eye on device error stats and will report if
 any of the counters (read errors, write errors, etc) of a device that is part
 of the filesystem is not zero.

Package: quilt
Description-md5: 8eeb0522bc56c3acd93b9e763f3dcd28
Description-en: Tool to work with series of patches
 Quilt manages a series of patches by keeping track of the changes
 each of them makes. They are logically organized as a stack, and you can
 apply, un-apply, refresh them easily by traveling into the stack (push/pop).
 .
 Quilt is good for managing additional patches applied to a package received
 as a tarball or maintained in another version control system. The stacked
 organization is proven to be efficient for the management of very large patch
 sets (more than hundred patches). As matter of fact, it was designed by and
 for Linux kernel hackers (Andrew Morton, from the -mm  branch, is the
 original author), and its main use by the current upstream maintainer is to
 manage the (hundreds of) patches against the kernel made for the SUSE
 distribution.
 .
 This package provides seamless integration into Debhelper or CDBS,
 allowing maintainers to easily add a quilt-based patch management system in
 their packages. The package also provides some basic support for those not
 using those tools. See README.Debian for more information.

Package: r-cran-bit
Description-md5: 1f7319050aa1386ab244caabc922c084
Description-en: GNU R class for vectors of 1-bit booleans
 This GNU R package provides bitmapped vectors of booleans (no NAs),
 coercion from and to logicals, integers and integer subscripts; fast
 boolean operators and fast summary statistics. With 'bit' vectors you
 can store true binary booleans {FALSE,TRUE} at the expense of 1 bit
 only, on a 32 bit architecture this means factor 32 less RAM and ~
 factor 32 more speed on boolean operations. Due to overhead of R calls,
 actual speed gain depends on the size of the vector: expect gains for
 vectors of size > 10000 elements. Even for one-time boolean operations
 it can pay-off to convert to bit, the pay-off is obvious, when such
 components are used more than once.
 .
 Reading from and writing to bit is approximately as fast as accessing
 standard logicals - mostly due to R's time for memory allocation. The
 package allows one to work with pre-allocated memory for return values
 by calling .Call() directly: when evaluating the speed of C-access with
 pre-allocated vector memory, coping from bit to logical requires only
 70% of the time for copying from logical to logical; and copying from
 logical to bit comes at a performance penalty of 150%. the package now
 contains further classes for representing logical selections: 'bitwhich'
 for very skewed selections and 'ri' for selecting ranges of values for
 chunked processing. All three index classes can be used for subsetting
 'ff' objects (ff-2.1-0 and higher).

Package: r-cran-bit64
Description-md5: e8cd547c29ff22fa3b9d0de8292fa529
Description-en: GNU R S3 Class for Vectors of 64bit Integers
 Package 'bit64' provides serializable S3 atomic 64bit (signed) integers.
 These are useful for handling database keys and exact counting in +-2^63.
 WARNING: do not use them as replacement for 32bit integers, integer64 are not
 supported for subscripting by R-core and they have different semantics when
 combined with double, e.g. integer64 + double => integer64.
 Class integer64 can be used in vectors, matrices, arrays and data.frames.
 Methods are available for coercion from and to logicals, integers, doubles,
 characters and factors as well as many elementwise and summary functions.
 Many fast algorithmic operations such as 'match' and 'order' support
 interactive data exploration and manipulation and optionally leverage caching.

Description-en: GNU R procedures for psychological, psychometric, and personality research
 This GNU R package provides a general purpose toolbox for personality,
 psychometric theory and experimental psychology. Functions are primarily
 for multivariate analysis and scale construction using factor
 analysis, principal component analysis, cluster analysis and
 reliability analysis, although others provide basic descriptive
 statistics. Item Response Theory is done using factor analysis of
 tetrachoric and polychoric correlations. Functions for analyzing
 data at multiple levels include within and between group
 statistics, including correlations and factor analysis. Functions
 for simulating and testing particular item and test structures are
 included. Several functions serve as a useful front end for
 structural equation modeling. Graphical displays of path diagrams,
 factor analysis and structural equation models are created using
 basic graphics. Some of the functions are written to support a
 book on psychometric theory as well as publications in personality
 research.

Description-en: Tomcat native library using the Apache Portable Runtime
 Tomcat can use the Apache Portable Runtime to provide superior scalability,
 performance, and better integration with native server technologies.
 The Apache Portable Runtime is a highly portable library that is at the
 heart of Apache HTTP Server 2.x. APR has many uses, including access to
 advanced IO functionality (such as sendfile, epoll and OpenSSL), OS level
 functionality (random number generation, system status, etc), and native
 process handling (shared memory, NT pipes and Unix sockets).
 .
 These features allows making Tomcat a general purpose webserver, will
 enable much better integration with other native web technologies, and
 overall make Java much more viable as a full fledged webserver platform
 rather than simply a backend focused technology.

Package: tor
Description-md5: 9106e8e4b3843ebd532ba2b89615a92e
Description-en: anonymizing overlay network for TCP
 Tor is a connection-based low-latency anonymous communication system.
 .
 Clients choose a source-routed path through a set of relays, and
 negotiate a "virtual circuit" through the network, in which each relay
 knows its predecessor and successor, but no others. Traffic flowing
 down the circuit is decrypted at each relay, which reveals the
 downstream relay.
 .
 Basically, Tor provides a distributed network of relays. Users bounce
 their TCP streams (web traffic, ftp, ssh, etc) around the relays, and
 recipients, observers, and even the relays themselves have difficulty
 learning which users connected to which destinations.
 .
 This package enables only a Tor client by default, but it can also be
 configured as a relay and/or a hidden service easily.
 .
 Client applications can use the Tor network by connecting to the local
 socks proxy interface provided by your Tor instance. If the application
 itself does not come with socks support, you can use a socks client
 such as torsocks.
 .
 Note that Tor does no protocol cleaning on application traffic. There
 is a danger that application protocols and associated programs can be
 induced to reveal information about the user. Tor depends on Torbutton
 and similar protocol cleaners to solve this problem. For best
 protection when web surfing, the Tor Project recommends that you use
 the Tor Browser Bundle, a standalone tarball that includes static
 builds of Tor, Torbutton, and a modified Firefox that is patched to fix
 a variety of privacy bugs.

Package: tor-geoipdb
Description-md5: d0b50c9cd91157b8c85856fd55e26d14
Description-en: GeoIP database for Tor
 This package provides a GeoIP database for Tor, i.e. it maps IPv4 addresses
 to countries.
 .
 Bridge relays (special Tor relays that aren't listed in the main Tor
 directory) use this information to report which countries they see
 connections from.  These statistics enable the Tor network operators to
 learn when certain countries start blocking access to bridges.
 .
 Clients can also use this to learn what country each relay is in, so
 Tor controllers like arm or Vidalia can use it, or if they want to
 configure path selection preferences.

Package: libunsafe-fences-java
Description-md5: 3e083c35292e0d5cff750122e0fbd1f0
Description-en: wrapper library around the Java 8 fences API
 unsafe-fences is a very simple Java library that just provides a shim
 around the Java 8 Unsafe methods used for memory fencing.
 .
 In Java 8, three memory-ordering intrinsics were added to the
 sun.misc.Unsafe class: fullFence, storeFence, and loadFence.
 .
 The main goal of unsafe-fences is to allow code in Java 6 and 7
 to compile those calls with a provided boolean guard.
 .
 This is especially useful for projects like JRuby that support
 several JDK versions but it can be reused by other Java projects as
 well.

Description-md5: 4b32ecafb8984d5447ca6fa3901e4281
Description-en: advanced memory forensics framework
 The Volatility Framework is a completely open collection of tools for
 the extraction of digital artifacts from volatile memory (RAM) samples.
 It is useful in forensics analysis. The extraction techniques are
 performed completely independent of the system being investigated but
 offer unprecedented visibility into the runtime state of the system.
 .
 Volatility supports memory dumps from all major 32- and 64-bit Windows
 versions and service packs. Whether your memory dump is in raw format,
 a Microsoft crash dump, hibernation file, or virtual machine snapshot,
 Volatility is able to work with it.
 .
 Linux memory dumps in raw or LiME format are supported too. There are
 several plugins for analyzing memory dumps from 32- and 64-bit Linux
 kernels and relevant distributions such as Debian, Ubuntu, openSUSE,
 RedHat, Fedora, CentOS, Mandriva, etc.
 .
 Volatility also support several versions of Mac OSX memory dumps, both
 32- and 64-bit. Android phones with ARM processors are also supported.
 .
 These are some of the data that can be extracted from a memory image:
    - Image information (date, time, CPU count);
    - Running processes;
    - Open network sockets and connections;
    - OS kernel modules loaded;
    - Memory maps for each process;
    - Executables samples;
    - Command history;
    - Suspicious process mappings (i.e. injected code);
    - Passwords, as LM/NTLM hashes and LSA secrets;

 user confirmation before responding to the sandboxed application's
 requests. For example, when the sandboxed application ask to open a file,
 the portal implementation will open an "Open" dialog outside the sandbox,
 and will only make the selected file available to the sandboxed app if
 that dialog is confirmed.
